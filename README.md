## Lemonade App
**Focus:** Working with observables, state, and recomposition.  

- Used `mutableStateOf` to track UI state and trigger recomposition.  
- Implemented buttons with click actions to progress through multiple UI states.  
- Practiced **state hoisting** and basic UI interaction flows.

## Tip Calculator
**Focus:** Testing, extension functions, and state handling.  

- Wrote **unit tests** and **instrumentation tests** to validate UI and logic.  
- Implemented **extension functions** for code clarity and reuse.  
- Continued practice with **observables** (`mutableStateOf`) to drive UI updates.  
- Explored the importance of separating **UI logic vs. business logic** for testability.
